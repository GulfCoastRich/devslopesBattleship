## About the Game

### The Board

The player chooses the size of the board. 
The choices are:
4x4
5x5
6x6

### The Ships

Hidden in the board will be two types of ships, "small" | "large". 

#### Small Ship

A Small ship will take up 2 spaces on the board, and to let someone know what type of ship they hit, this ship will show up as an orange circle.

So on your board, if you guess all the spots for a small ship it would look like this

```
ðŸŸ  | ðŸŸ 
```

or this

```
ðŸŸ 
--
ðŸŸ 
```

#### Large Ship

A Large ship will take up 3 spaces on the board, and to let someone know what type of ship they hit, this ship will show up as an Blue circle.

So on your board, if you guess all the spots for a blue ship it would look like this

```
ðŸ”µ | ðŸ”µ | ðŸ”µ
```

or this

```
